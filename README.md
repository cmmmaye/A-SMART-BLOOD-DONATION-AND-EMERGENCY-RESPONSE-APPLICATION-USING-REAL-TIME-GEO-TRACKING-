# Smart Blood Donation and Emergency Response Application

Project Overview

The Smart Blood Donation and Emergency Response Application is a mobile-based system designed to improve blood donation coordination and emergency response using real-time geo-tracking and donor matching. The application connects donors, recipients, healthcare organizations, and administrators on a single platform to reduce response time during urgent medical situations.

The system enables recipients to submit blood requests, allows organizations to review and approve or reject requests, and notifies nearby donors in real time. It also provides administrative features for managing users, organizations, announcements, and private communication.
